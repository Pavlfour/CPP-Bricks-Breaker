# CPP-Bricks-Breaker

ðŸš€A game which in the beginning you aim with the mouse to point where you want to have the ball launched and press space to do so.
You can move the paddle using left and right arrow keys. The ball as it collides with either the border of the screen or a brick it gets faster!
The game consists of 78 bricksðŸ§± in total (6 rows and 13 columns) and everytime we run the game new colors are chosen randomly to color each row!
I do not own any of the no-copyright sound effects added to the game.

I improved the physics of the collision between the paddle and the ball.
